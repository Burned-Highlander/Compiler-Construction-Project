# Compiler-Construction-Project
This project is a basic implementation of an operator precedence parser in C programming language that calculates the result of arithmetic expressions.

What are the restrictions in this project?
1. An arithmetic expression's MAXIMUM NUMBER of OPERANDS is limited to 5.
2. This parser DOESN'T HANDLE COMPLEX expressions that include BRACKETS.
